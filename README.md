Attendance System
Due to their capacity to streamline attendance tracking and 
management, automatic attendance systems have attracted lot of 
interest recently. In this project, a ML-based attendance system is 
proposed, which automatically detects and recognises faces in 
realtime using computer vision techniques.
The system can reliably identify and mark attendance without 
requiring human participation because it is designed to address the 
problems with traditional attendance systems, like manual tracking 
inaccuracies and time-consuming processes. To learn the traits and 
patterns that distinguish one person from another, the system is 
trained on a dataset of labelled face photos. In order to identify each 
person and record their attendance, the system takes a picture of 
them and compares it to a model that has already been trained.
A 98.5% accuracy rate was attained in tests on the suggested 
system, making it a dependable and effective method for 
automating attendance tracking. Additionally, the system 
demonstrated good outcomes in variety of difficult situations, 
including changes in lighting and variations in face expressions.
In conclusion, the suggested system provides a dependable and 
effective solution for automatic attendance tracking, which has the 
potential to eliminate errors and save time in the administration of 
attendance. Because of the system's reliance on machine learning 
techniques, it can reliably record attendance and operate in a variety 
of difficult situations
